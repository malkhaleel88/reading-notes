# **NODE.JS**

## **An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com**

 ### **What is node.js?**

 *As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications es Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.*

 ### **In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**

 *JavaScript compiler which work directly to native machine code that computer can execute. Enhanced by file system API, an HTTP library, and operating systems.*

 ### **What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**

 *execute JavaScript on our computers directly asynchronous.*

 ### **What is npm?**

 *Default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client.*

 ### **What version of node are you running on your machine?**

 *node -v , shows that version of node that I use : v14.17.0*

 ### **What version of npm are you running on your machine?**

 *npm -v , shows that version of node that I use : 6.14.13*

 ### **What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**

 *by writing this command on terminal: npm install -g jshint*

 ### **What is node used for?**

 *can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking…*
 *Node is often used to build back end services that communicate with client-side applications. These applications get and send data through a back end service called an API. The API serves as an interface between different programs so they are able to talk to each other.*

## **6 Reasons for Pair Programming**

 ### **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

 * Greater efficiency

 * Engaged collaboration

 * Learning from fellow students

 * Social skills

 * Job interview readiness

 * Work environment readiness

 ### **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

 *Engaged Collaboration and thinking together is always…*
 *But about learning from other fellow… if there is big difference in level between pair programmer one will learn from the other… if and efficiency become down and lower the progress… one get benefit and the other the opposite… whereas if the pair is suit and the level nearly close… it will be great and covers all mentioned point… Collaboration is super.*

 ### **How does pair programming work?**

 *Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.*
