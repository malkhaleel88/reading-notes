## **Allowing Other Apps to Start Your Activity**

### **What is the purpose of using intent-filter?**

Allow other apps to start an another activity.

### **How intent-filter works?**

* When the app is installed on a device, the system identifies an intent filters and adds the information to an internal catalog of intents, which supported by all installed apps.
* When an app calls `startActivity()` or `startActivityForResult()`the system finds which activity can respond to the intent and then add an Intent Filter.
* The system may send a given Intent to an activity if that activity has an intent filter.

* How I allow other apps to start an another  activity ?
  * add an `<intent-filter>` element in your manifest file for the corresponding <activity> element.
* How it works?
  * When the app is installed on a device, the system identifies an intent filters and adds the information to an internal catalog of intents.
  * Which supported by all installed apps.
  * When an app calls `startActivity()` or `startActivityForResult()`, with an `implicit intent`, the system finds which activity (or activities) can respond to the intent.

### **Add an Intent Filter**

The system may send a given `Intent` to an activity if that activity has an intent filter fulfills the following criteria of the `Intent` object:

* **Action**
  * A string naming the action to perform. Usually one of the platform-defined values such as ACTION_SEND or ACTION_VIEW.
* **Data**
  * A description of the data associated with the intent.
  * Category
  * Provides an additional way to characterize the activity handling the intent, usually related to the user gesture or location from which it's started.

**Example:**

```
   <activity android:name="ShareActivity">
     <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
        <data android:mimeType="text/plain"/>
        <data android:mimeType="image/*"/>
     </intent-filter>
  </activity>
```

## **Handle the Intent in Your Activity**

```
  @Override
 protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    // Get the intent that started this activity
    Intent intent = getIntent();
    Uri data = intent.getData();

    // Figure out what to do based on the intent type
    if (intent.getType().indexOf("image/") != -1) {
        // Handle intents with image data ...
    } else if (intent.getType().equals("text/plain")) {
        // Handle intents with text ...
    }
  }
```

## **Return a Result**

```
  // Create intent to deliver some kind of result data
 Intent result = new Intent("com.example.RESULT_ACTION", Uri.parse("content://result_uri"));
 setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK, result);
 finish();
```
