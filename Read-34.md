## **Sell goods or services through your app**

### **Sell digital goods or services with Google Play's billing system**

* Google Play's billing system makes it easy for users to consistently, securely, and seamlessly purchase your goods and services for your app.

* Developers who distribute their app through Google Play are required to use Google Play's billing system to sell in-app content.

* Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:
  * Virtual game products.
  * App functionality or content.
  * Subscription services.
  * Cloud software products.

### **Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay**

* Google Pay provides your customers a faster, safer way to pay online, both in apps and wherever contactless payments are accepted.

* Products where we recommend developers use Google Pay include the following:
  * Retail merchandise.
  * Physical services.
  * One-time membership fees or recurring dues.
  * Electronic bill payment.

## **Other app monetization options**

### **Advertising**

Get paid for showing Google AdMob ads, including native ads that allow you to match ads to your app's look and feel.

### **Paid apps**

Set a price for your app that the user must pay before they can download and install it. You can also take advantage of automatic local pricing (or set prices yourself), promo codes, and pricing templates.

## **Best practices for setting your initial monetization strategy**

* **Research other apps in your category:** Learn how other developers charge for their apps and content. Consider whether there are benefits to offering users alternative ways to pay.

* **Think about how your app will be used:** Your app's usage patterns can indicate the best monetization choices.

* **Make use of natural extensions:** If your app can be extended or expanded, such as with adding levels in a game, consider making the core app available for free and offering extended features through in-app purchases or subscriptions.

* **Consider your cost structures:** If you have significant recurring content costs, consider using subscriptions. Use a free trial period to encourage uptake.

* **Consider your audience:** For some audiences, the scope for using advertising, subscriptions, or in-app purchases can be limited.

* **Consider local factors when setting prices:** When setting prices for apps, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in specific markets, be sure to consider cost of living differences, local pricing patterns, pricing of competitive apps, and other market factors.

## **Best practices for optimizing your monetization strategy**

* **Analyze statistics in the Google Play Console:** Gain an understanding of your users' purchasing patterns, including statistics on average revenue per paying user and new versus returning buyers.

* **Understand purchasing behavior with Google Analytics for Firebase:** With data on up to 500 in-app events, Google Analytics for Firebase can provide insights into user buying behavior.

* **Run pricing experiments:** Use in-app A/B testing to experiment with different prices and alternative ways to encourage users to take up subscriptions or purchase in-app products.

* **Offer a sale price:** Paid apps can use strikethrough pricing in the Play Console to offer a discounted price for a limited time and encourage more purchases.
