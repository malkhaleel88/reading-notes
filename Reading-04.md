# **React and Forms**

## **React Docs - Forms**
 
 ### **What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**
 
 *A controlled component is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state.*

 ### **Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.**
 
 *We update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them, In most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”.*


 ### **How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**

 ```
 event.target.name
 ```

## **The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained**

 ### **Why would we use a ternary operator?**
 
 *Programmers use the ternary operator for decision making in place of longer if and else conditional statements.*

 ### **Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**
 
 ```
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
 ```

 *Answer:*
 ```
 x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
 ```
