# **Trees**

## **Common Terminology**

- **Root** - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- **K** - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- **Left** - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- **Right** - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- **Edge** - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- **Leaf** - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- **Height** - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## **Traversals**

### **1.Depth First**

- **Pre-order:** root >> left >> right
- **In-order**: left >> root >> right
- **Post-order:** left >> right >> root

- The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion.

### **2.Breadth First**

Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

### **Big O**

- The Big O **time complexity for inserting** a new node is **O(n)**.
- **Searching** for a specific node will also be **O(n)**, worst case we will have to look at n items, hence the O(n) complexity.

- The Big O **space complexity** for a node **insertion using breadth first insertion** will be **O(w)**, where w is the largest width of the tree.

- A **perfect** binary tree is one where every non-leaf node has exactly two children. `The maximum width for a perfect binary tree, is 2^(h-1), where h is the height of the tree. Height can be calculated as log n, where n is the number of nodes.`

## **Binary Search Trees (BST)**

- In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

- The best way to approach a BST search is with a while loop. ' We cycle through the while loop until we hit a leaf, or until we reach a match with what we’re searching for.'

### **Big O**

- The Big O **time complexity** of a Binary Search Tree’s **insertion** and **search** operations is **O(h)**, or O(height).
(In the worst case, we will have to search all the way down to a leaf).

- In a balanced (or "perfect") tree, the height of the tree is log(n). In an unbalanced tree, the worst case height of the tree is n.

- The Big O **space complexity** of a BST **search** would be **O(1)**.
