# **More CSS Layout**

**Screen Sizes** *Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.*

**Screen Resolution** *Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.*

**Page Sizes** *Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).*


## **Fixed-Width Layouts**

*Fixed layouts are layouts that start with a specific size as stipulated by the web designer. They remain that width, regardless of the size of the browser window viewing the page. Fixed-width layouts allow a designer more direct control over how the page will look in most situations. They are often preferred by designers with a print background, as they allow the designer to make minute adjustments to the layout and have them remain consistent across browsers and computers.*

## **Liquid Layouts**

*Liquid layouts are layouts that are based on percentages of the current browser window's size. They flex with the size of the window, even if the current viewer changes his browser size as he's viewing the site. Liquid-width layouts allow an efficient use of the space provided by any given browser window or screen resolution. They are often preferred by designers who have a lot of information n to get across in as little space as possible, as they remain consistent in size and relative page weights regardless of who is viewing the page.*
