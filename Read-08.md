## **Don't repeat yourself**

*"Don't repeat yourself" (DRY, or sometimes "do not repeat yourself") is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, Replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.*

*The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". The principle has been formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer. They apply it quite broadly to include "database schemas, test plans, the build system, even documentation". When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync. Besides using methods and subroutines in their code, Thomas and Hunt rely on code generators, automatic build systems, and scripting languages to observe the DRY principle across layers.*

## **Rule of three (computer programming)**

*Rule of three ("Three strikes and you refactor") is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when similar pieces of code should be refactored to avoid duplication. It states that two instances of similar code do not require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure. The rule was popularized by Martin Fowler in Refactoring and attributed to Don Roberts.*

*Duplication is considered a bad practice in programming because it makes the code harder to maintain. When the rule encoded in a replicated piece of code changes, whoever maintains the code will have to change it in all places correctly.*

## **You aren't gonna need it**

*"You aren't gonna need it"(YAGNI)is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."Other forms of the phrase include "You aren't going to need it"and "You ain't gonna need it".*

## **Minimum viable product**

*A minimum viable product, or MVP, is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle. In industries such as software, the MVP can help the product team receive user feedback as quickly as possible to iterate and improve the product.*

*Because the agile methodology is built on validating and iterating products based on user input, the MVP plays a central role in agile development.*
