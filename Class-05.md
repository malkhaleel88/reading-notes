# **HTML Images; CSS Color & Text**

## **HTML Images**

*Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.*

**HTML Images Syntax**

*The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
The `<img>` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.*

*The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:*

* **src** - Specifies the path to the image
* **alt** - Specifies an alternate text for the image

```
Syntax :

<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">
```

## **CSS Color**

*Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.*

## **CSS Text**

*The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories :*

* **Font styles** - Properties that affect the font that is applied to the text, affecting what font is applied, how big it is, whether it is bold, italic, etc.*
* **Text layout styles** - Properties that affect the spacing and other layout features of the text, allowing manipulation of, for example, the space between lines and letters, and how the text is aligned within the content box.*
