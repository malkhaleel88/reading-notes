## **Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency**

*Big O’s role in algorithm efficiency is to describe the Worst Case of efficiency an algorithm can have in performing it’s job. It specifically looks at the factors mentioned above, which we often refer to as Space and Time. In order to analyze these limiting factors, we should consider 4 Key Areas for analysis:*

* Input Size
* Units of Measurement
* Orders of Growth
* Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

### **Orders of Growth**

*We can describe overall efficiency by using the input size n and measuring the overall Units of Space and Time required for the given input size n. As the value of n grows, the Order of Growth represents the increase in Running Time or Memory Space.*

## **Linked Lists**

*A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.*

*There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation.*

### **ArrayList vs. LinkedList**

*The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList.*

*The LinkedList class has all of the same methods as the ArrayList class because they both implement the List interface. This means that you can add items, change items, remove items and clear the list in the same way.

*However, while the ArrayList class and the LinkedList class can be used in the same way, they are built very differently.*

*Use an ArrayList for storing and accessing data, and LinkedList to manipulate data.*
