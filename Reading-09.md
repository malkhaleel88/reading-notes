# **FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING**

## **Functional Programming Concepts**

 ### **What is functional programming?**

 *Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.*

 ### **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

 * It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).

 * It does not cause any observable side effects.

 ### **What are the benefits of a pure function?**

 *Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable. Given the same parameters, pure functions will always return the same result. We don’t need to think of situations when the same parameter has different results — because it will never happen.*

 ### **What is immutability?**

 *Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.*

 ### **What is Referential transparency?**

 *pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency*


## **Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()**

 ### **What is a module?**

 *Bit of code which has a certain functionality in our application and we can call it whenever we need it*

 ### **What does the word ‘require’ do?**

 *Keyword refers to a function which is used to import all the constructs exported .*

 ### **How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

 *require('module path')*

 ### **What do we have to do to make a module available?**

 *module.exports*
