# **REST**

## **What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team**

 ### **Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:**

 * **Psychological safety:** Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be   embarrassed or punished for doing so.
 * **Dependability:** Everyone completes quality work on time.
 * **Structure and clarity:** Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
 * **Meaning:** Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
 * **Impact:** Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.


## **How I explained REST to my brother**

 ### **Who is Roy Fielding?**
 
 *Some guy. He's smart,He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.*

 ### **Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

 *If everything that machines need to talk about has a corresponding URL, you've created the machine equivalent of a noun.*
 
 ### **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

  *All about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.*
 ### **What does a GET do?**

 *because browsers pretty much just GET stuff. They don't do a lot of other types of interaction with resources. This is a problem because it has led many people to assume that HTTP is just for GET'ing. But HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.*
 ### **What does a POST do?**

 *It would use an HTTP verb of POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.*

 ### **What does PUT do?**
 
 *If a system wants to replace something in another system.*

 ### **What does PATCH do?**

 *To do a partial update.*
