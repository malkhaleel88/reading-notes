*The `<form>` element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.*

*Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired.*

*The change in the state of an object is known as an **Event**. In html, there are various events which represents that some activity is performed by the user or by the browser. When javascript code is included in HTML, js react over these events and allow the execution. This process of reacting over the events is called **Event Handling**. Thus, js handles the HTML events via **Event Handlers**.*
