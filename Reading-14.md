# **Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry**
 
 
## **Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding**

 ### **What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?**

 *The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.*

 ### **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

 *This was a big deal when those kids got to college. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.*


## **Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies**

 ### **What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?**

 * In the last 12 months, Facebook, Apple, eBay and Microsoft hired 1% more women. LinkedIn increased their female staff by 3%. Google’s gender ratio stayed the same.

 * Microsoft gained 3% non-white employees, Facebook 2%; while Google, Apple and eBay increased their non-white staff by 1%. LinkedIn lost 3% of its non-white employees.

 * Within the companies who expanded their ethnic diversity, Asian staff accounted for the majority of the increase, while the ratio of Hispanic employees remained static. Apple registered the biggest jump: 3% increase in Asian hires.


## **Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company**

 ### **When are diversity efforts most successful?**

 *Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.*

 ### **Why do diverse companies perform better?**

 *Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.*

 ### **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**
 
 *When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.*
